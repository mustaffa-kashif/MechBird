# MechBird

## Project Description
I designed and developed a mechanical **Flappy Bird** game using **Arduino**, showcasing my skills in both hardware and software development. The game simulates the popular Flappy Bird mechanics, but with physical components. It features a **motorized conveyor belt** acting as obstacles and a **sensor-controlled bird** to detect objects in range.

The bird, controlled via a **string connected to a motor**, is navigated using a **button input**. The game includes an **LCD display** that tracks the score, which increases based on how long the player can avoid obstacles. The game ends when the bird collides with an obstacle.

This project was built using **C++**, and I used **Tinkercad** for simulating the code and circuit design, demonstrating both my programming and electrical engineering skills.

## Features
- **Conveyor Belt Obstacles:** A motorized belt acts as moving obstacles for the bird to dodge.
- **Object Detection (Bird):** The bird is equipped with a sensor to detect nearby obstacles.
- **Button Navigation:** The bird is controlled via a button, which moves the bird up and down.
- **LCD Score Display:** The score increases based on the time the bird avoids obstacles.
- **Collision Detection:** The game ends when the sensor detects a collision with an obstacle.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller used to control the entire setup.
- **Motorized Conveyor Belt**: Representing obstacles.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Used to detect the presence of obstacles near the bird.
- **Motor**: Controls the bird's vertical movement via a string.
- **Button**: Allows the player to move the bird up and avoid obstacles.
- **LCD Display**: Shows the player's score based on survival time.
- **Wires, Breadboard, and Power Supply**: For setting up the electrical circuit.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Hardware Development**: Designing and building the electrical circuit for controlling motors, sensors, and displays.
- **Software Development**: C++ programming to control the game logic, player input, sensor detection, and score display.
- **Embedded Systems**: Working with Arduino and Tinkercad to simulate and test the hardware and software components.

## Future Improvements
- Add more challenging levels by increasing the speed of the conveyor belt over time.
- Implement sound effects using a buzzer to enhance game immersion.
- Introduce a more dynamic scoring system based on difficulty level or obstacles avoided.

## Conclusion
This project allowed me to combine both hardware and software development into a cohesive game experience, showcasing my ability to design, code, and build a mechanical game using Arduino. By applying concepts of sensor control, motor management, and user interaction through buttons, I demonstrated my capability to develop complex embedded systems. This mechanical **Flappy Bird** game not only reflects my proficiency in **C++** programming and **circuit design**, but also highlights my creativity in transforming a digital game into a physical format. The project provides a strong foundation for future improvements and similar creative endeavors.
